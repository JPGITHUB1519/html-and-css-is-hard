    <h1>Interneting is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of heading.</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
      <li>Add each item it its own "li" element</li>
      <li>They do not need to be in any particular order</li>

      <!-- This is bad, ul elements should only contain li elements
        <p>THIS IS BAD</p>
      -->

      <!-- Instead, do this
        <li><p>Nice</p></li>
      -->
    </ul>

    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But, the list items elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>You should be noticing things in the precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Inline elements</h2>
    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
    <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importanse of a word or phrase.</p>
    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
    <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>

    <!-- never ever do this-->
    <!-- 
      <p>This paragraph needs some space below it...</p>
      <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
      <p>So, I added some hard line breaks.</p>

    <p>P.S. This page might look like crap. but we'll fix that with some CSS soon.</p>

    <!-- The Trailing slach / in all empty HTML elements is entirely optional -->
